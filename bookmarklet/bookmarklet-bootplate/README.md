Bookmarklet Bootplate
=========

Bookmarklet application template for Enyo2

Refer to the [Wiki](https://github.com/enyojs/enyo/wiki/Bootplate) for how to get started.

Deploy as per the regular Enyo bootplate, and your "App" kind will automatically be inserted into the Bookmarklet kind.

You will need to edit to loader.js to specify your server path. To run connectly on https websites, it's recommended you host your bookmarklet code on an https server as well. Dropbox is a great free solution.

Then simply copy the full URL path of your loader.js script into the [Enyo Bookmarklet Builder](http://jaycanuck.github.com/enyo-bookmarklet/) and a hyperlink will be generated that you can drag to your browser's bookmark toolbar.
