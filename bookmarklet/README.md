Enyo Bookmarklet
================
A proof-of-concept fully functional Enyo2 bookmarklet loader and enhanced Bookmarklet component.

[Bookmarklet Bootplate](https://github.com/JayCanuck/enyo-bookmarklet/tree/master/bookmarklet-bootplate)
--------
The bookmarklet loader and Bookmarklet popup control were designed to work hand-in-hand with the existing Enyo bootplate.  The standard debug.html and index.html files let you view and debug your app in full webpage form.

Once built/deployed, be sure to edit the loader.js to specify your server path. Then you just need to copy the full URL path of your loader.js script and put it into the [Enyo Bookmarklet Builder](http://jaycanuck.github.com/enyo-bookmarklet/), which will give you a hyperlink you can add to your browser's bookmark toolbar easily.
